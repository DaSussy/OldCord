# OldCord

A theme for Discord that brings back the classic 2020 UI without removing features.

![Preview](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1088094000294142033/1088154272283230208/image.png)

###### the folders are not part of the theme

Please note that OldCord does not revert the "mosaic" images. Use the [discord-no-mosaic](https://github.com/Tanza3D/discord-no-mosaic) plugin instead.

Enable "Sync Profile Themes" in Accessibility so profiles won't get bright
