# OldCord

A theme for Discord that brings back the classic 2020 UI without removing features.

![Preview](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1088094000294142033/1088154272283230208/image.png)

###### the folders are not part of the theme

## Additional stuff

OldCord does not revert the "mosaic" images. Use the [discord-no-mosaic](https://github.com/Tanza3D/discord-no-mosaic) plugin instead.

Use [NoSuperReactions](https://github.com/xenrelle/Xens-BD-Dump/tree/main/plugins/NoSuperReactions) to remove super reactions

Enable "Sync Profile Themes" in `Settings > Accessibility` so profiles won't become bright af
